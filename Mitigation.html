        <h1> Typhoon Mitigation </h1>
        <p> What is Typhoon Mitigation? Typhoon mitigation refers to the efforts and strategies put in place to minimize the impacts of typhoons, which are powerful tropical cyclones common in the Pacific Ocean. These efforts can include various strategies, such as disaster preparedness, early warning systems, infrastructure repair and strengthening, land-use planning and community education.</p>

 <h1 class="Title1">How can we mitigate the impacts done by Typhoons?</h1>
<div class="Info2">
    <div class="left2">
    <p>1.) There are numerous strategies we can use and make an effort to mitigate the effects that  Typhoons can do to us in order to make our home and community much more secure and less susceptible to the devastating effects of Typhoons.<br> This includes <strong class="strong">awareness to the Typhoon</strong>, proper education about the Typhoon and how we can deal with one. This can include <strong class="strong">Preparedness and Mitigation programs or lessons.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="right2">
    <p>2.) The local government can also make various changes to the local area such as <strong class="strong">making enhancements to their infrastructures</strong>, using much more better material that can stand up to harsher levels of Typhoons. They could also create walls to Typhoon-Prone areas and fix sewers to minimize the effects of flooding to Flood-Prone areas. <br> This isn't the only thing the local government cannot do either. They can also create programs that can help residents be more efficient when it comes to Typhoon such as <strong class="strong">arranging a Typhoon preparedness program</strong>  and giving out free assistance to those in need. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="Info3">
    <p>3.) The residents themselves can also make an effort in mitigating for Typhoons. Purchasing emergency items which include canned goods, spare clothing, flashlights, batteries, radios, etc. They can devise a <strong class="strong">proper emergency evacution plan</strong> whenever they need to evacuate in times of need to efficiently exit their building. <br> 4.) One should also always pay attention and <strong class="strong">listen to the TV and/or radio</strong> for updates about the Typhoon as they are crucial information you need in order to survive. <br> 5.) Individuals in the household can also take <strong class="strong">precautions</strong> while they are inside of their homes such as turning off the electrical breaker in order to avoid issues. <br> 6.) Always make sure to be careful in touching any wet surfaces in the house, especially if you have any wounds or cuts. <br> 7.) This calls to mitigation before a Typhoon. Have a proper electrician <strong class="strong">inspect your house</strong> for any faulties as a broken wire may be dangerous during Typhoons, always check around the house for any damages in order to prevent further accidents such as a water leak inside of the house. <br> 8.) Residents must also keep their important things in a <strong class="strong">safe area</strong>, perhaps a higher place if they are in a flood-prone area. <br> 9.) They should also always <strong class="strong">keep their doors and windows closed</strong> because of the strong winds brought on by Typhoons, your house may get damaged if you keep them open.</p>
